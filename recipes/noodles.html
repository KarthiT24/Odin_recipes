            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>To make a delicious noodle dish, start by boiling 200 grams of your preferred noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside. In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat and sauté 2 cloves of minced
                garlic and 1 tablespoon of grated ginger until fragrant. Add one chopped onion, one sliced bell pepper, one julienned carrot, and a cup of broccoli florets. Stir-fry the vegetables for about 5 minutes until tender-crisp. For the vegetarian
                version, add 1 cup of tofu cubes and cook until they are golden brown. Season with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of hoisin sauce, and a pinch of black pepper. Toss the cooked noodles into the pan and mix well until everything
                is evenly coated and heated through. For a non-vegetarian option, replace the tofu with 200 grams of thinly sliced chicken breast or shrimp. Cook the protein in the pan first, with a little salt and pepper, until fully cooked and then
                set aside. Proceed to sauté the garlic, ginger, and vegetables as described above. Once the vegetables are done, return the cooked chicken or shrimp to the pan, and season with soy sauce and hoisin sauce. Add the cooked noodles, and toss
                everything together until well combined and heated through. Garnish with chopped green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds before serving. Enjoy your flavorful, customizable noodle dish!</p>
