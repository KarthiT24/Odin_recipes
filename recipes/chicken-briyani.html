        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>To make a flavorful Chicken Biryani, start by marinating 500 grams of chicken with 1 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of biryani masala, 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste, and salt to taste. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes. In a large pot,
            heat 3 tablespoons of oil and fry 2 sliced onions until golden brown. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through. In a separate pot, boil 2 cups of basmati rice with whole spices (like bay leaf, cinnamon,
            cloves, and cardamom) until 70% cooked. Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken, sprinkle with saffron milk and fried onions. Cover and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes. For a vegetarian option, replace the chicken with 2 cups of
            mixed vegetables (like potatoes, carrots, peas, and beans) and follow the same marination and cooking process. Serve hot with raita and enjoy your delicious Chicken Biryani or Veg Biryani!</p>
